# RTCC alarm interrupt

This example application shows how to use the RTCC to configure the time and generate the alarm.

## Description

This example application shows how to setup RTCC time and configure alarm using the RTCC Peripheral Library. The application sets up an alarm to be generated every day at a specified time. A message is sent via the Virtual COM port on the alarm trigger.

### Setting up [PIC32MM USB Curiosity board](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/DM320107)

- To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:
  - [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click)

- Connect micro USB cable to the 'USB1' connector on the board to the computer
- Install an [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) on to the mikroBUS socket J4
- Connect mini USB cable between PC and the [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click)

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. Console output will be as given below in the beginning:
