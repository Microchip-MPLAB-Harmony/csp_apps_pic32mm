# DMAC usart echo

This example application demonstrates USART transfer with DMA to receive 10 bytes and echo back the received bytes

## Description

This application demonstrates USART transfer with DMA using SERCOM peripheral configured in USART mode. One DMA channel is used to receive 10 bytes of data from the USART and another DMA channel is used to echo back the received bytes.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_pic32mm) and then click **Clone** button to clone this repository or download as zip file.

### Setting up [PIC32MM USB Curiosity board](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/DM320107)

- To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:
  - [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click)

- Connect mini USB cable to the 'USB1' on the board to the computer
- Install an [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) on to the mikroBUS socket J4
- Connect mini USB cable between PC and the [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click)
  - *Note: Ensure that the series resistors on the mikroBUS headers are of value 0 Ohms*

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. Following message is output on console:

5. Type 10 characters in the terminal. It will echo back the received bytes and toggles the LED

The following table provides the LED name:

| Board      | LED Name |
| ---------- |--------- |
|  [PIC32MM USB Curiosity board](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/DM320107) | LED1 |
