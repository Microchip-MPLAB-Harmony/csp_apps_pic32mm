# DMAC memory transfer

This example application demonstrates how to use the DMAC peripheral to do a memory to memory transfer.

## Description

The application uses a software trigger to initiate a memory-memory transfer from the source buffer to the destination buffer with 16-bit beat size and 32-bit beat size. Transfer status is reported on console.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_pic32mm) and then click **Clone** button to clone this repository or download as zip file.
This content can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/dmac/dmac_memory_transfer/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

### Setting up [PIC32MM USB Curiosity board](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/DM320107)

- To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:
  - [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click)

- Connect micro USB cable to the 'USB1' on the board to the computer
- Install an [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) on to the mikroBUS socket J5
- Connect mini USB cable between PC and the [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click)
  - *Note: Ensure that the series resistors on the mikroBUS headers are of value 0 Ohms*

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. Following message is output on console:
