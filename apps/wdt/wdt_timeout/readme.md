# WDT timeout

This example application shows how the watchdog timer resets by not feeding the watchdog on switch press.

## Description

This example application shows how the WDT peripheral library resets the watchdog timer by not feeding the watchdog on switch press. The application sets up the watchdog to reset the device. The application also sets up the timer to blink an LED to emulate a process. A user switch press forces the device to wait in an infinite loop to emulate a deadlock. As a result a device reset is triggered as the watchdog counter overflows the bounded value.

## Downloading and building the application

### Setting up [PIC32MM USB Curiosity board](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/DM320107)

- To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:
  - [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click)

- Connect micro USB cable to the 'USB1' connector on the board to the computer
- Install an [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) on to the mikroBUS socket J4
- Connect mini USB cable between PC and the [USB UART click board](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click)
  - *Note: Ensure that the series resistors on the mikroBUS headers are of value 0 Ohms*

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. LED should be blinking and the console displays the following message

    ![output](images/output_wdt_timeout_1.png)

5. Press the switch to put the system in a deadlock
6. LED should stop blinking and the console should print the following message

    ![output](images/output_wdt_timeout_2.png)

7. WDT will reset the device in four seconds and the demonstration should restart
